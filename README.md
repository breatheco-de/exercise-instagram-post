## üå± How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `html template repository` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command. 

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```text
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello
```

**Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

> üí° Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.


## Strategy

Start by identifying which HTML `<tags>` you can use for the website, like `<div>`, `<p>`, etc. 

Here is a quick visual hint on a good strategy:

![Strategy for instagram post](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-instagram-post/blob/master/instagram-post-strategy.gif?raw=true)

To make your post look like the sample, you will need to use a `Roboto-type` font from Google Fonts and icons from Font Awesome:

- [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/) ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: [import font-awesome from a CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome) (copy the first link) instead of the main website (ask the teacher for details if you need them)


## What to do if you are stuck?

Ask the instructor or classmates right away!!!!

[!WARNING]
Do not stay stuck for more than 15 min because this is one of your first exercises, and you are not expected to know everything. Ask questions!!!
