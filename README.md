# The Instagram Post
<!-- endhide -->
Instagram is one of the most popular user interfaces in the world, this is the first of three exercises that will make you replicate the most important and difficult parts of Instagram.com.

In this case, we are starting with a single post.

## üå±  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository.

a) If using Gitpod (recommended) you can clone the boilerplate by [clicking here](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello).

b) If working locally type the following command from your command line: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello
```

üí° Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.


## Instructions

Create the HTML and CSS needed to replicate [this exact same picture](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-instagram-post/blob/master/preview.png?raw=true).

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-instagram-post/blob/master/preview.png?raw=true" height="300" /></p>

## Strategy

Start by identifying which html `<tags>` you can use for the website, like `<div>`, `<p>`, etc. 

Here is a quick visual hint on a good strategy:

To make your post look like the sample, you will need to use a Roboto-type font from Google Fonts and icons from Font Awesome:

- [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/) ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: [import font-awesome from a CDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/) instead of the main website (ask the teacher for details if you need them)


## What to do if you are stuck?

Ask the instructor or classmates right away. Do not stay stuck for more than 15 min because this is one of your first exercises and you are not expected to know everything. Ask questions!!!
