## 🌱  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `html template repository` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command. 

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello
```

**Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

💡 Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.


## Strategy

Start by identifying which html `<tags>` you can use for the website, like `<div>`, `<p>`, etc. 

Here is a quick visual hint on a good strategy:

![Strategy for instagram post](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-instagram-post/blob/master/strategy.gif?raw=true)

To make your post look like the sample, you will need to use a Roboto-type font from Google Fonts and icons from Font Awesome:

- [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/) ⚠️ Important: [import font-awesome from a CDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/) instead of the main website (ask the teacher for details if you need them)


## What to do if you are stuck?

Ask the instructor or classmates right away. Do not stay stuck for more than 15 min because this is one of your first exercises, and you are not expected to know everything. Ask questions!!!
